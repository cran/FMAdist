Description: Creation of an input model (fitted distribution) via the frequentist model averaging (FMA) approach and generate random-variates from the distribution specified by "myfit" which is the fitted input model via the FMA approach. See W. X. Jiang and B. L. Nelson (2018), "Better Input Modeling via Model Averaging," Proceedings of the 2018 Winter Simulation Conference, IEEE Press, 1575-1586.
